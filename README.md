Mint Classics SQL Analysis 🚗📊

This repository contains my SQL portfolio project based on the fictional Mint Classics Company, a retailer of classic model cars.
The project demonstrates how SQL can be applied to solve real-world business problems such as inventory optimization and warehouse management.
